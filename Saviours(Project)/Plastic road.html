                <p class="lead">Rajagopalan Vasudevan, is an Indian scientist who has worked mainly in waste management.
                    He is currently a professor in Thiagarajar College of Engineering. He developed an innovative method
                    to reuse plastic waste to construct better, more durable and very cost-effective roads. He thought
                    up the idea of shredding plastic waste, mixing it with bitumen and using the polymerized mix in road
                    construction. This method will help in making roads much faster and also will save environment from
                    dangerous plastic waste. He also visited Mahatma schools on 15 April 2008. The roads also show
                    greater resistance to damages caused by heavy rains. His road construction method is now widely used
                    to construct roads in rural India. He was awarded India's fourth highest civilian honour Padma Shri
                    in 2018.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Plastic roads first developed by Rajagopalan Vasudevan in 2001, consist of an
                        asphalt mix with plastic waste incorporated into the asphalt mixture. The implementation of
                        plastics in roads also opens a new option for recycling post-consumer plastics. Australia,
                        Indonesia, India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and many other countries have used
                        technology that can incorporate plastic waste into an asphalt mix. In the Netherlands in the
                        cities of Zwolle and Giethoorn, there are two bicycle paths made purely from waste plastics.
                        This is the result of a collaboration between three companies: VolkerWessels, Wavin, and Total.
                        The "Plastic Road" cannot be compared with normal plastic roads. The "PlasticRoad" built by the
                        three companies consists of prefabricated, hollow, modular elements made from consumer waste
                        plastics, and is a unique innovation all over the world. The original idea for the PlasticRoad
                        was invented by Simon Jorritsma and Anne Koudstaal. In 2015, the PlasticRoad concept was
                        presented to the world with the goal of finding partners to bring the idea to reality. The
                        PlasticRoad has a lot of advantages compared to normal roads, including hollow space for the
                        storage of excessive rainwater, lightweight, and sustainability benefits.</p>

                                <p class="lead">Since plastic roads are a relatively new idea, construction processes
                                    vary. In Jamshedpur, India, roads are created from a mix of plastic and bitumen. In
                                    Indonesia, roads are also being built using a plastic-asphalt mix in many areas
                                    including Bali, Surabaya, Bekasi, Makassar, Solo, and Tangerang.

                                    These roads are made from recycled plastics, and the first step in constructing them
                                    is to collect and manage the plastic material. The plastics involved in building
                                    these roads consist mainly of common post-consumer products such as product
                                    packaging. Some of the most common plastics used in packaging are polyethylene
                                    terephthalate (PET or PETE), polypropylene (PP), and high- and low-density
                                    polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE). These materials are first sorted from plastic waste.
                                    After sorting, the material is cleaned, dried, and shredded. The shredded plastic is
                                    mixed and melted at around 170 Â°C. Hot bitumen is then added and mixed with the
                                    melted plastic. After mixing the mixture is laid as one would with regular asphalt
                                    concrete.

                                    So far, no large-scale, systematic approach has been employed to build roads
                                    entirely of plastics in the Netherlands. On 13 September 2018, the Dutch company
                                    Volkerwessels built a bicycle path made of recycled plastic in Zwolle, in the
                                    northeast part of the Netherlands. According to the Guardian, "A second path is to
                                    be installed in Giethoorn in Overijssel, and Rotterdam is the city most likely to
                                    take up the technology."</p>
